# Completion (Post-Authorization)

## Overview

You should complete the payment when you are ready to dispatch your product.

If you have used the transaction type Pre-Authorization when your customer checked out in your webshop, funds have been reserved on the customer's card account but have not been transferred to your account yet.

In order to complete a transaction and initiate the settlement process, you will need to send a Post-Authorization (postauth) via our API or initiate the completion manually using our Virtual Terminal.
