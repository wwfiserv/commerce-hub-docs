# Complete the Transaction

## Overview

When you click the Continue button, all your entries are validated. If pieces of information are missing or incorrect, the Virtual Terminal main page will reappear with an error message at the top and the incorrect or missing fields flagged with an error graphic. If this should occur, make the appropriate corrections to the fields, then click the Continue button again. 

If there are no apparent invalid entries, a review of all the information you entered with a request for confirmation will appear. Review the information and, if necessary, click on Back and make any corrections. Otherwise, click on Submit.

The Transaction Result screen will appear. The result screen will contain all the information you entered, plus an extra section at the top called Transaction Information.
